# Conflict Management Styles Quiz

A web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) that helps users identify their conflict management style through an interactive quiz.

## About the Project

This application presents users with a series of questions about how they handle conflict situations. Based on their responses, it evaluates their tendencies across five conflict management styles:

- **Collaborating**: Finding win-win solutions that satisfy all parties
- **Competing**: Pursuing your own concerns at the expense of others
- **Avoiding**: Sidestepping or withdrawing from conflict situations
- **Accommodating**: Prioritizing others' concerns over your own
- **Compromising**: Finding middle-ground solutions that partially satisfy all parties

After completing the quiz, users receive personalized results with a radar chart visualization and detailed descriptions of their primary and secondary conflict management styles, including when each style is most appropriate to use or avoid.
